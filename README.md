# Filter Objects
The plugin creates a new custom post type - "object" and taxonomy "object-category". It filters the custom post type by taxonomy and custom field "status" using ajax.

# Usage
You need to add a shortcode to the page.
```
[object_filter]
```

# Installation
1. Upload `filter-objects` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Use shortcodes to display the filter.
